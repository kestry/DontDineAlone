Architectures used:

    The architectures used are Model-View-Presenter (MVP) and Clean Architecture.
    It is a simplified adaptation of code found at:

        https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture

    which shows how a codebase gradually transitions into more sophisticated structures.

    MVP is as follows:

        [physical data] -- [model of data] -- [presenter that uses  -- [view which are dumb
                                               the model and views      UI services like
                                               to create our            widgets/buttons/etc]
                                               presentation
                                               for the user]

    Clean Architecture inserts another layer to MVP in between model and presenter. This layer
    is called the domain and consists of use cases and business logic.

    In our project, we call use cases "services" to also make this more intuitive.

    At the moment, the layout has heavy dependency usage because of the direct calls to Entity.
    But since we are mostly new to the technologies and concepts, it is a simpler start.

Codebase Layout:

Folders:
- data

- domain

- res

- util

- main (not in folder): Contains our activities or "views".
