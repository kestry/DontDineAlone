# DontDineAlone
CS115 Project 
Project Members: Tyler Hu, Cody Cunningham, Jean Park, Tarun Salh, Mac Huynh 

Idea: This is a android based app. The idea is to connect UCSC students who want to meet other UCSC students through dining. This app allows only UCSC students to register and log in. Then after logging in, they can choose to dine, which then the app connects them to a firebase database of anyone else that wants to eat and the connections would be in groups 2 or more people. Then the app will help them find the closest dining hall between them.

4/20 - At this point in time, we only have a login system. The matching system will be implemented in future weeks.
